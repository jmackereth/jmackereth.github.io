This is the second of a series of symposia organised by the SDSS IV Milky Way as a galaxy (MWAG) working group, intended to promote science and discussion in and around the theme of understanding the context of the Milky Way within the broader realm of galaxy formation and evolution.

The scope of these symposia is to bring MWAG science out of telecons and into a more widely accessible domain and to trigger new ideas and discussion. The format will be three science talks, ~20(+10) minutes in length, followed by a 30 minute structured discussion.

This symposium will focus on the physics and effects of radial migration in galaxy disks and what it can tell us about galaxy formation. We have three invited speakers (click the dropdown for abstracts):
