title:  Starting out on a blog
---

I've decided to have a go at writing a blog of some sort. I don't know what shape it will take yet, but the general plan is to use it to write about ideas and things that I think about on the broad theme of 'being a scientist'. I know for certain that I am specifically going to avoid writing 'tutorial' style blog posts, at least to start with - I dont feel qualified or inspired to do that just now, and there is just so much _great stuff_ out there already.   

Primarily, I've decided to write more to improve that part of my skill set. I welcome you, whoever you are, to come with me on that journey. Perhaps we can both get something out of it, but I can't guarantee that my rambling will be worth the read. Doing this 'publicly' will, I hope, motivate me to make it worthwhile for myself, and maybe for you!

In the first instance, I plan to write up some ideas that have been bubbling away in the back of my head since I started my PhD, about what it means to be 'creative' as a scientist - and, conversely, what creativity means for science.  Let's see how it goes. Welcome!
